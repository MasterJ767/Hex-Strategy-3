Hex Strategy Game
=====================

This work-in-progress game is a unity project inspired by Civilisation VI and Humankind. 

This is the second iteration of the project. The first followed the Catlike Coding tutorial more strictly. This version uses my own implementations but follows the tutorial series for a suggested structure on when to include which features.
